# Bookings and Reservations

This is the repository for a bookings and reservations project.
I built this by following along in Trevor Sawler's course: [Building Modern Web Applications with Go (Golang)](https://www.udemy.com/course/building-modern-web-applications-with-go/).
- Built in Go version 1.18.3
- Uses the [chi router](https://github.com/go-chi/chi)
- Uses [Alex Edwards SCS](https://github.com/alexedwards/scs/v2) session management
- Uses [nosurf](https://github.com/justinas/nosurf)
